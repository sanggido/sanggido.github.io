    title: Career Profile
    summary: |
      I'm a hardware engineer at Samsung Electronics(Foundry). I majored in VLSI/CAD algorithms, especially
      focusing on the physical design optimization such as placement or routing. I got M.Sc and B.Sc degree
      from UNIST, Ulsan. My advisor professor is Seokhyeong Kang at POSTECH, Pohang. I use C++ for write a program 
      and farmiliar with using Verilog, System Verilog, and Tcl script. I'm interested in physical design optimization and circuit design.
